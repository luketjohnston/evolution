If I get this error when using eksctl:
Error: checking AWS STS access â€“ cannot get role ARN for current session: operation error STS: GetCallerIdentity, https response error StatusCode: 0, RequestID: , request send failed, Post "https://sts..amazonaws.com/": dial tcp: lookup sts..amazonaws.com: no such host
If I just specify the region to be us-west-2, then it works again.

TODO: havent figured out how to connect to rabbitmq UI
